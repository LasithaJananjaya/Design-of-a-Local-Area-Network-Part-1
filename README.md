# Design-of-a-Local-Area-Network

This is a group activity conducted under the module EN2150 Communication Network Engineering, Semester 4 of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, university of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

The task descprition of the group activity is as follows.

You are expected to design the backbone network for University of Moratuwa (UOM) and the internal network of one building (ENTC).  Please follow the instructions given carefully:

1. UOM has multiple buildings housing academic faculties/departments, administrative offices, library and data center building (Center for Information Technology Services - CITeS).  All these building need to be connected.

Backbone network is designed for long term use (say 20-25 years).  It is important to consider the total cost for cabling.  Your design must contain both active and passive systems. (Follow the best practices as given in the lecture notes.) 

2.  Study the local area network of ENTC as a reference design for LAN.  You should look the complete network and how the cabling network is laid, different elements of the cabling network such as network sockets, patch panels (copper as well as fibre), distribution racks, copper and fibre patch cords, network switches and routers etc.,

3.  Use GNS3 network emulator to simulate ENTC network first and then see the possibility to do the same for backbone network.
